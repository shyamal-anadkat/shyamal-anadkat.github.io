The vision couldn’t be clearer: nearly every field of human endeavor can be improved by AI, often in transformative ways. the economic incentives are big. the technology is finally capable. The societal will to adopt AI is growing as success stories pile up. Thoughts on pairing that vision with action: 

**Think in terms of "AI for X"**

What problem or industry do you know deeply? start there and imagine an "AI for X" solution. the pattern from history is clear - domain insiders who embrace new tech build the breakout applications. just like a finance expert with software skills built the first electronic trading systems, today a finance expert with AI skills will build the next-gen trading agent. domain expertise + AI capability is an unfair advantage.

**Leverage the compound interest of AI**

AI improvements compound across workflows. a coding agent that makes coding 50% faster enables creation of more AI-powered tools - this is a positive feedback loop. invest in infra, tools, compute, evals, and data that accelerate AI development and deployment. think AI-boosted AI. speed and scale matter.

**Don’t underestimate voice and multimodal interfaces**

Voice is going to be huge because it opens AI to everyone, including those who aren’t glued to screens. computer vision and robotics are advancing fast, too. the best AI companies will meet users where they are - sometimes that’s a terminal or an API, but often it’s in a natural conversation or a real-world setting. make AI intuitive and useful, and you unlock massive markets.

**Focus on real economic value**

AI is cool but real value comes from solving real problems - saving time, reducing cost, improving quality, creating new capabilities. the best AI companies can answer one simple question: how does this make someone’s life easier or enable something previously impossible? the case for AI practically sells itself when tied to key metrics like revenue, cost, customer satisfaction, or productivity. quantify your impact. data-driven proof points sharpen your product and attract customers.

**Trust is essential**

Building with AI carries responsibility. UX, transparency, and safety aren’t just checkboxes - they’re critical to long-term success. the companies that thrive will be the ones users trust. testing for safety, engaging with stakeholders, and being transparent about limitations isn’t just the right thing to do - it’s good business. trust opens doors to regulated industries and builds durable companies. treat it as a core part of your strategy, not an afterthought. we're here to build safe agi.
