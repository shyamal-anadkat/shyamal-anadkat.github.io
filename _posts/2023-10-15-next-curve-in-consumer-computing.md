We are going through a paradigm shift in how we interact with technology. Our relationship with consumer tech has evolved considerably over the past decades, from entertainment-focused devices like radios and TVs to the highly personalized and interconnected computing devices we have today. The drive to create, share, and distribute knowledge at scale and the necessity to stay connected drove the adoption of smartphones. Every technological breakthrough has led to the creation of serious hardware that fundamentally changes how we learn, work, connect, think, and live. As we stand on the precipice of an exponential growth curve in artificial intelligence, it's worth considering where the next curve in consumer technology may lead us. 


**Our Path Thus Far**


Looking back, the evolution of consumer technology (a form of technology intended for use by consumers in the public) has been driven by the underlying goal of making daily tasks simpler, expanding human capabilities, and changing how we get work done. Mass communication devices like the radio and television transformed entertainment and information distribution in the early 20th century. The rise of personal computers in the 1980s enabled individual productivity and creativity. And over the past decade, smartphones have untethered computing power from the desk, allowing constant access to information and communication from anywhere. Platforms and applications on consumer hardware also create new economies, marketplaces, and jobs (e.g.: Uber, Airbnb, Shopify, Gaming, and so on).


Each step of change was underpinned by revolutions in technology, from vacuum tubes to integrated circuits to multitouch screens. But the primary driver has always been addressing human needs and enhancing quality of life. As Marshall McLuhan wrote, "We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us."


**The Next Shift**


We now stand at the inception of what could be the most profound technological advancement yet - safe artificial general intelligence (AGI). As this consumer technology comes to fruition, how will consumer electronics evolve? What needs will the next curve aim to address? artificial general intelligence won’t be delivered on a react-based web app or desktop or handheld. It’s something else entirely. And it just won’t be a single piece of consumer technology like a phone that permeates through every layer of society and at a tech store at every corner. It will be a consumer technology you choose, based on your personalized needs and the level of “invasiveness” and utility you prefer.


I foresee the demise of what we know as "medium-invasive" devices. These are the smartphones, laptops, and tablets that have become constant companions - always needing our attention with notifications and distractions, yet remaining external tools rather than extensions of our minds and bodies. The next shift will lead consumers towards two extremes in their relationships with consumer technology.


On one end, we will see a rise in minimalist devices aimed at reducing cognitive load and screen time. Already, products like the Apple Watch and Humane Ai pin are streamlining functions to cut down on tedious app interactions. The Humane Ai Pin is a screenless, standalone device and software platform built from the ground up for AI. Voice interfaces and AI agents will also augment these devices' capabilities, while keeping interfaces intuitive and touch input at a minimum. For those seeking to digitally detox from constant stimulation and engagement with screens, these minimalist devices could hit the sweet spot.


On the other end, immersive technologies like augmented and virtual reality will pull users ever deeper into digital environments and experiences. Modern VR/AR headsets remain fairly bulky contraptions, but continual improvements in hardware, interfaces, and graphical fidelity will soon make extended reality engagement feasible and comfortable. As Meta notes, "We see smart glasses as a stepping stone to true AR glasses, and an important element of this is building something you’ll want to wear regularly for extended periods.” When compelling applications emerge across entertainment, communication, education, and productivity, XR/extended reality could become a platform for hours of daily use - the antithesis of minimalism.


This divergence is unsurprising given the diversity of consumer needs and preferences. But it highlights how the medium-invasive devices many of us currently spend hours per day engaged with may fall out of favor. The "Goldilocks" level of consumer technology immersion these devices represent can leave users dissatisfied - not quite disconnected enough from the digital, but also not benefiting from the depth of immersion possible.


**Shifting Interaction Paradigms**


Transitioning from medium-invasive gadgets towards minimalist and immersive extremes will require rethinking how we interact with consumer technology. In particular, two interaction shifts stand out as opportunities.


First, the rise of predictive user interfaces powered by AI will transform our devices from reactive tools to proactive assistants. Rather than explicitly commanding devices through input and intent-based design, systems will increasingly understand contextual cues and anticipate user needs to provide relevant information and services autonomously.


For example, imagine an AR assistant that monitors your focus during meetings at work. It could be known from past behaviors and cues like eye movements when your attention wanders. The system might then unobtrusively provide you with supplemental information to reengage you. This shift from humans manipulating devices to devices intelligently assisting humans is essential for consumer technology to integrate deeper into our lives.


Second, new input mechanisms will emerge that are better suited to minimalist and immersive interactions. Thumb-typing on screens is unlikely to be the ideal means of communicating with augmented reality systems or brain-computer interfaces. Voice input has made great strides but still faces challenges with accuracy and privacy. Input modalities based on eye tracking, facial expressions, haptics, and spatial gestures are growing areas of innovation. And as technologies like Neuralink progress, direct brain communication could one day become viable as well.


The interplay between hardware design and human anatomy is also key - just look at how the thumb's dexterity catalyzed smartphone adoption. As designers consider how new devices integrate with our bodies and minds, new interaction mechanisms tailored to each extreme will develop. Wearable and even implantable technology could become prevalent, integrating seamlessly into the human body.


**Preserving Our Humanity**


Ultimately, the next evolution in consumer technology cannot be deterministic. It must balance meeting human needs with preserving what makes us human in the first place.
As immersive computing pioneer Jaron Lanier has noted, one risk of extended reality and pervasive ambient computing is losing a sense of what is "real" versus simulated. Noted philosopher Alva Noë argues humans cannot outsource our thinking and intention to machines without losing our humanity.

Therefore, as we embrace new capacities, we must also cultivate mindfulness about how we integrate these technologies into our lives. Hardware design will need to strike the right balance between functionality, aesthetics, and sustainability. Finding an equilibrium between humanity and consumer technology is critical for all innovations.

The coming shift away from medium-invasive devices to minimalist and immersive extremes has parallels to the demise of the PDA after the smartphone's rise. It will mark the next chapter in the commodification of computing power and redefine society's relationship to consumer technology. But by focusing first on human needs and second on technological means, we can ensure this coming curve bends towards empowering our lives while respecting human exceptionalism. The future remains unwritten, and it is up to us to shape it wisely.
