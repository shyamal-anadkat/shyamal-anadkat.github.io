Hire people who are not just smart, but who share the intensity of your mission. If someone comes aboard primarily because they think your startup might take off, their commitment will never run as deep as someone who is there because they genuinely care about what you’re building. The true believers are the ones who stay late not out of obligation, but because they’re still thinking through new angles on a tough problem. They see your company as their vehicle to shape the future, and they want to be there when the world finally wakes up to what you’ve created.

Give them more than just a paycheck—give them the tools they need: compute, capital, and the freedom to try bold ideas. Pay attention to what sparks their curiosity and then supercharge it. That’s how you align incentives with meaningful progress, and that’s what leads to breakthroughs that can improve how we live and work.
