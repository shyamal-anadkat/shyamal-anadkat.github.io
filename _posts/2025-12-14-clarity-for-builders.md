clarity is the hidden unfair advantage. when you know exactly what you want to build, you move faster, you avoid the fake work, and you say no to every shiny distraction. most people drift; the ones who get somewhere decide where they're going and keep checking the compass. clarity is the compass.

clarity also makes it easier to recruit people to your cause. nobody wants to join a fog. if you can explain the mission in a few sentences and the milestones in a few more, you give people something to push against. it becomes possible to choose, to prioritize, to relentlessly remove anything that doesn’t move the needle. clarity gives you a strong center and leaves room to adapt at the edges.
