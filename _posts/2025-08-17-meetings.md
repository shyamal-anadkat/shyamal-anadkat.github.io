Meetings are expensive. Default to async.

Send a link. I’ll respond fast. Prefer demos, code, or a live URL over memos.

### What to send (in order of preference)

- Live URL or staging link
- Repo link or PR (point to the exact files)
- Short Loom or demo (≤3 minutes)
- Data snapshot: 3–5 numbers that matter
- Draft that needs comments (doc/email/PRD). Skip decks.

### Minimum info

- Goal: what you want from me (decision, feedback, intro)
- Context: 2–3 lines on why now and the key constraint
- Deadline: when you need an answer
- What you tried: one line
- Preferred response: bullets, Loom, comments, or a 20‑min call

### When to meet

- Sensitive topics or high‑stakes decisions
- Live whiteboarding/debugging
- Fundraising or senior recruiting
- Ambiguous 0→1 strategy that needs quick convergence

If we meet, keep it to 20 minutes with a clear agenda and links sent first.

### How I respond

- Clear and contained: I reply async right away
- Needs rapid back‑and‑forth: I propose a short call
- Not the right fit: I say so quickly and try to redirect

### Template

Subject: [topic] — need [decision/feedback/intro] by [date]

- Goal: [what you want]
- Context (2–3 lines): [why now + key constraint]
- Links: [live URL] [repo/PR] [demo/Loom]
- Data (optional): [3–5 numbers]
- Preferred response: [bullets / Loom / comments / 20‑min call]

Fast, low‑friction, no calendar ping‑pong.
