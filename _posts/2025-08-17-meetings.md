Meetings are expensive. Default to async.

Send a link. I’ll respond fast. Prefer demos, code, or a live URL over memos.

### Philosophy

Default bias: solve it now. When someone asks to meet, I try to resolve the problem immediately.

Put the details, context, pitch, or exact question in the message. If it’s truly important, I’ll just call you.

Calendar overhead (emails, scheduling, Zoom links) hides weeks of delay. Many things can be figured out in minutes — right now.

### What to send (in order of preference)

- Live URL or staging link
- Repo link or PR (point to the exact files)
- Short Loom or demo (≤3 minutes)
- Data snapshot: 3–5 numbers that matter
- Draft that needs comments (doc/email/PRD). Skip decks.

### Minimum info

- Goal: what you want from me (decision, feedback, intro)
- Context: 2–3 lines on why now and the key constraint
- Deadline: when you need an answer
- What you tried: one line
- Preferred response: bullets, Loom, comments, or a 20‑min call

### When to meet

- Sensitive topics or high‑stakes decisions
- Live whiteboarding/debugging
- Fundraising or senior recruiting
- Ambiguous 0→1 strategy that needs quick convergence

If we meet, keep it to 20 minutes with a clear agenda and links sent first.

### How I respond

- Clear and contained: I reply async right away
- Needs rapid back‑and‑forth: I propose a short call
- Not the right fit: I say so quickly and try to redirect

If you don’t hear back, I’m likely very busy and/or not the right person.

### Template

Subject: [topic] — need [decision/feedback/intro] by [date]

- Goal: [what you want]
- Context (2–3 lines): [why now + key constraint]
- Links: [live URL] [repo/PR] [demo/Loom]
- Data (optional): [3–5 numbers]
- Preferred response: [bullets / Loom / comments / 20‑min call]

Fast, low‑friction, no calendar ping‑pong.
