The 'deep' in deep tech is a reminder of the technical risk and uncharted territory we must traverse.

I. Think big, begin small.

Dream and plan for a future that may seem improbable, to think boldly and unrestrictively about possibilities. However, recognize that the path to greatness begins with the first step.

II. Focus on first principles.

Re-examine assumptions, and understand the fundamental truths. Consider problems from first principles, striving to deconstruct complex issues into their most basic elements.

III. Build differently and durably.

Incremental improvements may not be sufficient. Deep tech often demands a shift paradigms, challenging the status quo and building from the ground up.

IV. Monopoly For mission.

As you aim for the big problems, remember that the only sustainable business is a monopoly. Competition is for losers. Build for dominance in domains neglected or unfathomed.

V. Long-term vision and thinking in decades.

In deep tech, our timelines stretch beyond the immediate horizons of traditional tech cycles.be prepared for the long haul, expecting 5, 10, 20-year journeys.

VI. No substitute for technological and research breakthrough.

Gains in deep tech are rooted in actual advances in science and engineering. There is no substitute for 'hard' technology.

VII. Build to solve.

Identify real, pressing problems, and provide viable, scalable, and practical solutions. Technology is a means, not an end.

VIII. Resilience through uncertainty.

Given the high risk and uncertainty inherent in deep tech, cultivate a culture of resilience. Failure may be more frequent, but the successes have exponential impact.

IX. Build a learning organization.

Foster a team that values continual learning, curiosity, and knowledge across domains.

X. Ethics and responsibility.

Be acutely mindful of the societal impact of your technologies. Act ethically, with a long-term sense of responsibility.

XI. Funding From visionaries.

Seek funding from those who understand the uniqueness and timescales of deep tech, and who invest in fundamental innovation.

XII. Network and collaborate.

Deep tech requires cross-pollination of ideas across disciplines. Build collaboration and connection with academia, industry, and governments.

XIII. Hands-on leadership.

Be in the trenches. Understand the technology, and be involved in the key decisions.

XIV. Remember humanity.

Your purpose is to advance human progress, to solve Earth's pressing problems, and to expand the reach of human civilization.

Deep tech is perhaps the most challenging and rewarding endeavor in modern times. Let's extend this blueprint as an invitation to embrace this journey with courage, vision, and resolve.
