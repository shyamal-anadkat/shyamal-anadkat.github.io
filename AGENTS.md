# Agent Instructions

## Scope
These instructions apply to the entire repository unless superseded by a nested `AGENTS.md`.

## Authoring posts
- Preserve existing front matter fields (layout, title, tags, date) and keep titles and body text in lowercase to match the current style.
- Keep prose concise and avoid filler such as “not X but Y” contrasts.
- When changing dates, ensure filenames and front matter stay aligned.

## Workflow
- Describe changes clearly in commit messages and PR summaries.
- If adding or modifying content, skim for obvious typos and maintain markdown formatting.

## Testing
- Run only the tests or checks relevant to the touched areas. If nothing is appropriate, note that testing was not run.
