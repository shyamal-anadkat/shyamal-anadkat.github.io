# Reading History

Track your blog reading journey and see what posts you've read recently.

{% include reading-history.html show_stats=true %}

## About Reading History

This feature automatically tracks:
- **Posts you visit**: Any blog post you open gets added to your history
- **Reading progress**: How far you've scrolled through each post  
- **Completion status**: Posts are marked as "fully read" when you scroll past 70%

All data is stored locally in your browser and is not shared or tracked externally.

### How it works

1. **Automatic tracking**: Just read posts normally - no setup required
2. **Progress tracking**: Scroll progress is saved as you read
3. **Local storage**: All data stays on your device
4. **Privacy focused**: No external tracking or analytics

### Privacy

Your reading history is stored locally in your browser using localStorage. This means:
- Data never leaves your device
- No server-side tracking
- You can clear it anytime
- Works offline
